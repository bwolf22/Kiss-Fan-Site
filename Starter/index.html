  <p><strong>Kiss Bio:</strong></p>
  <div class="tablebox">
  <p>Kiss dominated the Rock and Roll world for 50 years. Founded by Gene Simmon and Paul Stanley, the band started out playing in New York City clubs in 1973. Having released three albums by 1975, Kiss struggled to gain consistent traction once they released their Alive album, a live recording of shows. This album displayed the band's raw and natural sound, which put them on the map. Kiss turned its product into more than just music. Each concert is a theatrical spectacle that allowed them to rock for 50 long years.
